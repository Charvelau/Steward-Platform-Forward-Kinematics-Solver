# Background

In the summer of 2006 I accompanied Dr. Akihiko Kumagai (CSU Sacramento) to work at the Contact Dynamics Simulation Laboratory (CDSL) at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). While there we worked on a close-form solution to the forward kinematics of the CDSLs 6-DOF CDSL Stewart platform. Our project was a matlab implementation of the algebraic method of solving the forward kinematics described in the following paper:

    Forward kinematics of the general 6-6 Stewart platform using algebraic elimination.
